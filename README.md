There once was a [little turtle](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4f/69/89/4f6989c2080b5f0ccc2f7bdae7807f1d.jpg), swimming around with her parents. The little turtle was very curious, and loved to go and look around. This time, while her parents were talking about what brand of kelp to buy, she decided to visit a strange looking cave.

### The decision

This mysterious cave was called the "cave of the monster".No one had ever come out of it alive.
The little turtle decided to go inside.
