There once was a [little turtle](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4f/69/89/4f6989c2080b5f0ccc2f7bdae7807f1d.jpg), swimming around with her parents. The little turtle was very curious, and loved to go and look around. This time, while her parents were talking about what brand of kelp to buy, she decided to visit a strange looking cave.

### The decision

This mysterious cave was called the "cave of the monster".No one had ever come out of it alive.
The little turtle decided to go inside.

After swimming for a few moments in the clear, cool water, the little turtle was tired.
She decided to rest for a few moments are a rocky outcrop.
She rested for a few minutes in the greatest of calm.
But this calmness left the place to an *enormous noise*, a kind of rumbling.

### Fear or curiosity

The little turtle was torn between fear and curiosity.
This noise came from deeper in the cave someone was screaming in fear and pain, **Stanley the turtle** began to swim as fast as he could until he got his leg stuck between two huge rocks. With fear the seconds seemed to last for hours, the "Thing" came closer and closer, before noticing that it was her parents who had been looking for her for too long.
